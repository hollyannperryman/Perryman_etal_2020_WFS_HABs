Notes: Balancing Ecopath
  Notice, in "Input" > "Basic input" values are provided for all four key parameters for all multi-stanza groups. Thus, when balancing Ecopath the user will be promted: "Biomass, PB, QB and EE for [functional group name] are entered. Do you want to estimate biomass accumulation?" Select "Yes" for all multi-stanza functional groups in order to balance Ecopath to reflect the model published by Perryman et al. (2020).
